## Overview
This project is a Python application that leverages web scraping to extract job information from the 104 Job Bank website. 
It includes functionality to scrape various types of job listings, such as:
 - applied jobs
 - search results
 - similar jobs

The scraped data is then stored in Excel files for further analysis or reference.

## Future Plans
### 1. Firestore Persistence
I plan to enhance data storage options by adding support for Google Firestore. This will provide a cloud-based storage 
solution, enabling users to persist scraped job data in a more scalable and accessible manner.

### 2. Extension to Other Job Portals
Expanding the project's capabilities to include scraping logic for other job portals is on the roadmap. 
This will involve creating additional scraper classes or modifying the existing logic to accommodate different websites, 
allowing users to extract job data from a broader range of sources.

[//]: # (### 3. Improved Configurability)

[//]: # (I aim to make the project more configurable by introducing settings or configuration files. This will allow users to )

[//]: # (easily customize parameters such as search criteria, headers, and storage locations without modifying the code directly.)

[//]: # (### 4. GUI Interface)

[//]: # (Considering the user experience, I plan to develop a simple graphical user interface &#40;GUI&#41; that facilitates easier )

[//]: # (interaction with the scraper. The GUI will provide options for initiating different types of scrapes, viewing results, )
